OSU CS Coursework

This is my repository for my CPP coursework for Oregon State Universities CS online program. I am a fairly new programmer,
as illustrated by some of my code, but I can usually accomplish what I intend. A majority of this work is a good representation
of my learning process as well. Mistakes beget learning.
